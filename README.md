A web portofolio showcasing skills of Wisa Ahmaduta Dinutama (19623058), Windows XP Edition! Contains short description of myself, previous organizational experience, projects and achievements, and even my socials (yes, even myAnimeList)

# The Tech Thingy Behind
This project is built using the Next.js framework and TypeScript, with styling handled by Tailwind CSS and some vanilla CSS. The interface includes various clickable buttons, most of which serve as hyperlinks to external pages. Additionally, certain buttons trigger the rendering of a card component that displays content related to the selected topic.

# How to View the Project
[I have deployed the project to vercel in this specific hyperlink (just click on this blue thingy)](https://wisauce-portofolio.vercel.app/)

# Bonus Points Checklist
- deployment ✅ (finished)
the link is literally above this text if it's not obvious enough
- responsive ⚠️ (partially finished)
i don't actually use any media query or tailwind "breakpoint" but i considered responsivity in the process of creating the layout and the results is proven by its usability through other devices with different screen size (checked on my iphone 13 and redmi note 10)
- use of database or CMS ❌ (not applied)
i don't understand a thing about this bung
- creativity ✅ (finished)
my friend complimented my project as "konsepnya mahal" today and i am so happy with it. There are also a couple more people that really likes my concept of the web layout and even me myself think that it's such a crative decision to go with the windows xp theme.

# Things i've Struggled With
This project marks my first experience with Next.js, as I previously worked with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The transition was challenging, especially since I had no prior experience with TypeScript, React, or Tailwind CSS. The steep learning curve, combined with the frequent frustration of debugging syntax errors, made the process quite tough.

However, despite the initial confusion (including a particularly frustrating five-hour period), I learned a great deal. I gained an understanding of how Next.js integrates various technologies to streamline web development, and I noticed differences in how JavaScript logic behaves in this new environment.part of this journey. On the good side, i actually learned a lot of things from this like how Next wraps everything together and helps us to make web projects in a more efficient way (despite the fact that it confused me for a good 5 hours) and how the javascript logic that i've learnt before behaves differently in the environment i created in Next.js
