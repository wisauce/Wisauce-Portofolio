A web portofolio showcasing skills of Wisa Ahmaduta Dinutama (19623058), Windows XP Edition! Contains short description of myself, previous organizational experience, projects and achievements, and even my socials (yes, even myAnimeList)

# The Tech Thingy Behind
The technology that is used in this project is the framework Next.js, with the language itself typescript, using the library tailwind and a little bit of vanilla CSS. Most of the clickable buttons are hyperlink to the corresponding external pages. Some of the buttons leads to render a card in which contains the content of the topic.

# How to View the Project
[I have deployed the project to vercel in this specific hyperlink (just click on this blue thingy)](https://wisauce-portofolio.vercel.app/)

# Bonus Points Checklist
- deployment ✅ (finished)
the link is literally above this text if it's not obvious enough)
- responsive ⚠️ (partially finished)
i don't actually use any media query or tailwind "breakpoint" but i considered responsivity in the process of creating the layout and the results is proven by its usability through other devices with different screen size (checked on my iphone 13 and redmi note 10)
- use of database or CMS ❌ (not applied)
i don't understand a thing about this bung
- creativity ✅ (finished)
my friend complimented my project as "konsepnya mahal" today and i am so happy with it. There are also a couple more people that really likes my concept of the web layout and even me myself think that it's such a crative decision to go with the windows xp theme.

# Things i've Struggled With
This is officially my first Next.js based project since before this i usually make things in vanilla HTML CSS and Javascript. Considering the amount of steps that are skipped (without prior understanding of typescript, react, and tailwind) this project was indeed a challenging one. The constant questioning of how the system works and irritating errors caused by weird syntax rule is definetely the most frustrating part of this journey. On the good side, i actually learned a lot of things from this like how Next wraps everything together and helps us to make web projects in a more efficient way (despite the fact that it confused me for a good 5 hours) and how the javascript logic that i've learnt before behaves differently in the environment i created in Next.js
